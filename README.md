# README

This is a test of the Glitch platform to see if we can use it for CoderGirl lessons.

First thoughts:
- It was unclear that adding forward slashes `/` to the name of files would effectively place them in new directories.
  - Displaying files in a flat manner like `_/css/styles.css` could help reinforce path structure for students.
- Glitch can connect to a GitHub repo, will need to test out that workflow and how commits might work
- Not sure how the built in Glitch Debugger and Console might work into the CG coursework, yet.
  - Oh! `git` is installed in the Glitch console, which is a shell! This is where CGs will need to do their git work
  - Ah! You can create directories and files via command line in the Glitch console. (Doesn't refresh automatically, but that's how `test/test.txt` was created: `mkdir test; touch test/test.txt; vim test/test.txt`.
